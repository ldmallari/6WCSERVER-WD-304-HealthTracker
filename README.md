The Health Tracker is a web-based application designed to help individuals monitor and manage their personal health and wellness journey. It provides a centralized platform where users can log various health metrics, visualize their progress through interactive reports, and access educational content. The goal of this application is to bridge the gap between personal health awareness and actionable insights by offering tools to track exercise, sleep, water intake, mood, and nutrition in one unified system.

This project aims to address common issues such as fragmented health data, lack of awareness, difficulty accessing reliable health information, and limited visualization of progress.
